# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This [project] (https://kimyonsoo.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/) is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief given on [Figma] (https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1). It was made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Project features

- Semantic HTMLs
- Flexbox
- Flat BEM file structure
- Responsive design
